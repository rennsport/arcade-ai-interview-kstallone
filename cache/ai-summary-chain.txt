The user began their journey by searching for a "Scooter" on the website. After typing in the search query, they scrolled through the search results and clicked on the 'Razor A5 Lux 2 Wheel Kick Scooter' to learn more about its features and see the available options. While on the product page, they scrolled further and selected the 'Blue' color option, then explored more color choices by clicking on 'Pink'. Satisfied with their selection, they added the scooter to the cart to secure it before it sells out. They declined adding a protection plan at that moment and proceeded to the cart by clicking on '1'. Finally, they performed a dragging action, possibly to rearrange or review the items in the cart before proceeding to checkout.
