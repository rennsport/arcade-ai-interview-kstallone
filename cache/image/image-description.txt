"Design a visually appealing image that captures the user journey of purchasing a scooter from Target without using any words. The image should be highly engaging and suitable for sharing on social platforms. It should convey the user's actions of searching, scrolling, selecting, adding to cart, and dragging to checkout. Use creative elements and colors to represent the different steps of the journey. Keep the image under 1000 characters including whitespace to ensure optimal social media compatibility."
